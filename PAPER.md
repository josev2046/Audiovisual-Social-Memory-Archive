# Audiovisual-Social-Memory-Archive
Preserving endangered audiovisual records of 20th-century social movements through collaborative digitisation and open access.
(Paper presented at the IASA 2022 Annual Conference.)

## Abstract

The audiovisual memory recorded on film and magnetic media by social collectives in the last third of the 20th century faces a significant risk of disappearing. We aim to preserve this crucial perspective of history. To achieve this, we propose creating a network, driven by audiovisual, archival, and citizen participation professionals, to connect two complementary agents: social collectives and individuals owning audiovisual materials, and cultural institutions responsible for document preservation. This non-profit collective seeks to contribute participatively to conserving the audiovisual memory of social movements and to recognize Collective Memory as part of a pluralistic perspective of history.

## Introduction

The proliferation of audiovisual recording technologies in the second half of the 20th century allowed social movements to document their activities and perspectives in an unprecedented way. However, the physical media of these recordings, such as magnetic tapes and films, are vulnerable to degradation and obsolescence. The loss of these materials would mean the disappearance of a vital part of social and cultural history.

## Objectives

* Locate and catalog audiovisual materials belonging to social movements (neighborhood, environmental, pacifist, feminist, etc.).
* Digitize these materials with the highest quality to ensure their long-term preservation.
* Describe each audiovisual using professional archival criteria to facilitate access and understanding.
* Enrich the materials with testimonies and references from protagonists, adding historical and personal context.
* Disseminate the audiovisuals through a web platform with open licenses for artistic, educational, and academic use.
* Conserve the originals and digital copies through agreements with cultural preservation institutions.

## Methodology

The proposed collaborative network is based on the participation of three main agents:

1.  **Social collectives and individuals:** Provide access to audiovisual materials and contextual knowledge.
2.  **Audiovisual and archival professionals:** Carry out the digitization, description, and conservation of materials, ensuring technical quality and archival integrity.
3.  **Cultural preservation institutions:** Offer infrastructure and resources for the long-term conservation of original materials and digital copies.

The methodology includes the following phases:

* **Location and cataloging:** A network of "memory gatherers" will be established to identify and catalog audiovisual materials.
* **Digitization and description:** High-quality equipment and software will be used to digitize the materials, followed by detailed description according to archival standards.
* **Enrichment and dissemination:** Testimonies and references from protagonists will be collected, and the materials will be published on a web platform with open licenses.
* **Conservation:** Agreements will be established with cultural institutions for the long-term preservation of the materials.

## Expected Results

* Creation of an accessible digital archive of the audiovisual memory of social movements.
* Preservation of a pluralistic perspective of history.
* Promotion of the educational, artistic, and academic use of audiovisual materials.
* Strengthening collaboration between social collectives, professionals, and cultural institutions.

## Contribution

This project contributes to the preservation of audiovisual heritage and the recognition of collective memory as a fundamental part of history. By adopting a collaborative and open approach, it seeks to democratize access to history and promote its use for education and research.
